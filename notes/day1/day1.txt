==== C Primer ====
Maybe we can send an email saying to brush up on C beforehand? The first
session is pretty packed.

==== Assembly Primer ====
This will go over registers, mov, push, pop, lea, add, sub, imul, idiv,
and the cdecl calling convention.

==== ELF Format ====
Today is about learning how programs are created and executed in precise
detail. Write the following program in your text editor of choice, and save it
as addder.c:

#include <stdio.h>

int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main(void) {
    int a, b, c;

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    c = sum(a, b);
    printf("The sum of those numbers is %d\n", c);

    return 0;
}

Then run "gcc -m32 -o adder adder.c" from the directory where you saved the
program.  The result is a binary file called adder. You may run it with
./adder if you wish.

If you run "cat adder", you'll see a blob of bizarre characters and whitespace.
This is your terminal doing its best to interpret binary data as text
characters. You'll notice that it doesn't do a very good job, although you can
still make out a few things like "ELF" at the beginning and "Enter two
numbers". Our new goal is to understand the structure of this blob.

The reason cat does such a bad job is because it's interpreting binary data as
ASCII. To examine the compiled program properly we need a way to view it as
individual bytes. To do that, we use a hex dumper. We will use xxd.

Run "xxd -g 1 adder | less" and take a look at ELF-Walkthrough.png.  This
picture breaks down the ELF format into 3 parts, a top header, sections, and
a bottom header. The first few bytes of our program contain the following
information:

EI_MAG
7F 45 4C 46
0x7F identifies the binary as an ELF file. 0x45 0x4C 0x46 is the hexadecimal
representation of the characters "ELF".

EI_CLASS, EI_DATA
02 01
The 0x02 signifies a 64-bit program, and the 0x01 signifies that the ELF's data
is stored in little-endian byte order.

EI_VERSION
01 00 00 00 00
This field specifies the ELF header version number. There is currently only one
version, so this value must be 1.

(empty bytes)
00 00 00 00 00

e_type
02 00
This field specifies the ELF file type. The 0x02 means this file is executable.

e_machine
3E 00
This field specifies the required architecture for this program. 0x3E
corresponds to AMD x86-64 architecture.

e_version
01 00 00 00
This field specifies the object file version. There is currently only one
version, so this value must be 1.

e_entry (0x00400500)
00 05 40 00 00 00 00 00
This field specifies the memory address from which the program starts
executing. Unlike the example in ELF-Walkthrough.png, it is 8 bytes (64 bits)
long, as specified in EI_CLASS.

We now know at a high level what happens when gcc compiles a C program. It
simply creates a new file, identifies it as an ELF binary, writes in all this
information in the ELF format, then writes in the machine code equivalent of
the C code being compiled. We'll come back to machine code later. For now we
will talk about the main components of an ELF binary: symbols, sections, and
segments.

Symbols are the "functions" of the binary. They map names (like printf or sum)
to locations in memory. You can view the symbol table for adder by running
readelf --symbols adder or nm adder. You'll see that the symbol for printf is
listed in a different section than the ones for main and sum. That's because
those functions reside in shared libraries, not within the binary itself (if
you want you can have them reside in the binary with gcc's -static flag, but
this has drawbacks).

Symbols are composed into sections, each of which serves a different purpose.
For instance the .text section contains the program instructions, and .rodata
contains read-only data such as the strings we hard-coded into the adder. You
can view the program's sections with readelf --sections adder or
objdump --section-headers adder. You can also see the hard-coded strings by
looking at the .text section in objdump --full-contents adder

Sections are further composed into segments, which are used at runtime to
separate different parts of the program into memory. You can view the program's
segments with readelf --segments adder.

==== Reverse Engineering Tools ====
Now that you have some knowledge of what you're dealing with, we can introduce
the reverse engineering tools you have at your disposal.

Our reversing tool is the humble file command. This command simply prints
information on the type of file it is called on. You can run file on adder to
see that it is a 32-bit ELF excutable. While it may be simple, don't forget
about this command as a key to understanding what sort of file you're up
against.

We've seen our next reversing tool already: objdump. This simple yet useful
tool allows us to see the machine code of any binary, and in theory is all we
need to reverse engineer any program. It's output tends to be rather abstruse
however, so we will need other methods as our programs become more complex.

Our next plan of attack is to see what we can learn just by reading it off the
binary, like the hard-coded strings in the .rodata section of the adder. The
tool for this job is called strings. You can run strings adder to see the ascii
strings it contains.

We can also learn about a binary through the functions it calls. ltrace will
execute a program while simultaneously dumping information on the dynamic
library calls it makes, and strace does the same with system calls. You can try
them both on adder to see how they work.

Since the ELF binary contains source code, why not simply overwrite it? We can
use a hex editor edit files at the byte level, which means we can overwrite
instructions even after a program has been compiled. Run "objdump -M intel -d
adder" and search for the sum symbol. You'll notice that the two numbers are
added with "add eax,edx" which is represented as 01 d0 in memory. 
Suppose we wanted a subtractor instead. If we replace the add instruction with
a subtract one, the arguments will be subtracted instead.

We need to find the memory representation (or opcode) for "sub eax,edx". We
will use a tool called rasm2. Run "rasm2 'sub eax, edx' to get the desired
opcode. The opcode for "sub eax,edx" is 29 d0.

Now we need to edit the binary. Just as objdump is used to view binaries at a
byte level, a hex editor is used to edit files at the byte level. Open adder in
wxHexEditor and find the bytes representing the add instruction (compare
against objdump to ensure you're editing the right bytes). Then replace them
with 29 d0. Save the new file and make it executable with chmod +x <file>. Run
the new file and see the result.

This brings us to the most powerful tool in the reverse engineer's toolkit -
the debugger. Debuggers allow us to step through a program's execution one
instruction at a time, all while viewing and even editing memory and register
contents.

==== GDB ====
Now for a quick walkthrough of the GNU Debugger, or GDB for short. Run "gdb
./adder". It will seem like nothing has happened, because nothing really has.
gdb has loaded the program into memory and that's about it. But under gdb you
can control the flow of the program's execution. To start out, run disassemble
main (or disas main for short). This produces a objdump-like view of main(). To
view the corresponding opcodes as well, run "dissasemble /r main".

Our next task is to pause execution when the program enters main. To do this
type break main (b main) followed by run (r). Execution will pause at main().
From here you can view the surrounding memory with the x command. This command
uses the format "x /[number][format][size] address". The default number is 1,
default format is hex (x), and default size is word (w). My program paused at
0x080484d6, and disassemble /r main shows the opcodes there are 83 ec 14. When
I run "x /3b 0x080484d6" I see "0x80484d6 <main+14>:    0x83    0xec    0x14".

Now say I want to examine the arguments to sum() being passed on the stack.
Look at the output of "disassemble main" to see where the arguments are pushed
onto the stack. My output has "0x08048515 <+77>:    52      push   edx", so
I'll run "break *0x08048515" to set a breakpoint there. The * is necessary
because this is a memory address, not a symbol like main. Then I'll run
"continue" (c) to resume execution until just before the push (you'll notice
you have to enter the numbers to be added. Choose 256 256).

Now execution has paused just before the push instruction. There are a few ways
to view the stack from here. First we need the address stored in the esp
register. We can run "info registers" to see the values of each register, or
"info register esp" to see just the value of esp. When I run "info register
esp" I see "esp            0xffffcf98       0xffffcf98". Therefore I can view
the first 12 words (4-byte-chunks) on the stack with "x /12xw *0xffffcf98". My
output is below.

0xffffcf98:     0xffffcfa4      0x080485ab      0x00000100      0x00000100
0xffffcfa8:     0xffffd06c      0xdf002f00      0xf7fa73dc      0xffffcfd0
0xffffcfb8:     0x00000000      0xf7e0d637      0xf7fa7000      0xf7fa7000

This is one way to view the stack, but there's actually a much simpler one. You
can run "x/12xw $esp" to acheive the same result.

Now lets watch the first argument get pushed onto the stack. I can check the
next few commands to be run with "x/10i $eip" or "x/10i $pc". To execute a
single instruction, run "nexti" (ni). Now run "x/12x $esp" again. Notice that
the first number you entered is now on the top of the stack. If you entered
256, the top of the stack will be 0x00000100.

To see the next argument be pushed onto the stack, run nexti/ni again followed
by "x /12x $esp". The top of the stack will now have two words with the value
0x00000100. If you run "x/10i $pc" again, you'll see that the next instruction
is the call to sum(). If you run "nexti" again, gdb will simply execute the
call to sum and continue when it finishes back in main(). We will step into the
call by running "stepi" (si) then view the new instructions with "x/10i $pc".

(gdb) x/10i $pc
=> 0x80484bb <sum>:     push   ebp
   0x80484bc <sum+1>:   mov    ebp,esp
   0x80484be <sum+3>:   mov    edx,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8]
   0x80484c1 <sum+6>:   mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0xc]
   0x80484c4 <sum+9>:   add    eax,edx
   0x80484c6 <sum+11>:  pop    ebp
   0x80484c7 <sum+12>:  ret
   0x80484c8 <main>:    lea    ecx,[esp+0x4]
   0x80484cc <main+4>:  and    esp,0xfffffff0
   0x80484cf <main+7>:  push   DWORD PTR [ecx-0x4]

The code for this function is simple enough to be read directly! A new stack
frame is set up, the arguments ([ebp+0x8] and [ebp+0xc]) are loaded into
registers, and they are added, with the result going into eax. Just to verify
our intuition, pause before the first mov instruction, "mov    edx,DWORD PTR
[ebp+0x8]". You could do this with a breakpoint, but you could also run
nexti/ni twice (protip: if you press enter at the gdb prompt with no input, the
previous command is run again). Then run "x/x $ebp+0x8" and "x/x $ebp+0xc". As
expected, they contain the earlier input. From here you can poke around more if
you like, or finish the program with continue (c). Then run "quit" (q) to exit
gdb.

Now gdb is a great tool and I highly recommend becoming proficient with it, but
the learning curve is admittedly a little steep. There are countless extensions
to gdb out there, and for this class we're going to use one called voltron,
both because it's a great tool and because your instructor has contributed to
it. To use voltron, first split your terminal into 4 panes. One one, run
"gdb-voltron adder" (note that this is an alias). From the others, run "voltron
view disasm", "voltron view registers", and "voltron view stack". Then back in
the pane with gdb run "break main" followed by "run" (or just "start") and
watch gdb turn into a graphical debugger before your eyes!

From here, we'll try some crackmes.
